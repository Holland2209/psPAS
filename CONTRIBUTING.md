### Pull Requests

When submitting a Pull Request to psPAS, automated tasks will run in Appveyor.

- Appveyor will increment the version number (there is no need to do this manually)
- The [`Pester`][pester-repo] tests for the module will run.
- [Code Coverage][code-coverage] metrics for the module will be determined
- Once code is merged into the `master` branch, and all tests pass, the module is automatically published to the PowerShell Gallery and tagged as a Release on GitHub
  - No PR's should be submitted to the master branch; submitting to the Dev branch allows for required tests & documentation to be updated prior to any code release.
